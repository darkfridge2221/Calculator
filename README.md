# This calculator has multiple functions
# On the main GUI, the r means radians, the d means degrees, and i means inverse (for the trig functions)
# It is able to calculate quadratic equations
# It is able to carry out SUVAT equations
# You can store values in 5 variable locations
# You can plot graphs but must be in a certain format. Below are examples of graphs it can plot and examples of the format:
# Trig graphs, sin(x), sin(2*x)
# Log graphs, log10(x), ln(5*x)
# Modulus graphs, mod(x)
# Linear, Quadratic and graphs of higher powers, 5*x**2, x**3, x**5 + 5*x - 2
